        <P>Duration: 3 Months</P>
        <p>The Wagon Weight Detector is a Embedded System IoT based project. The problem statement was in SIH, provided by Ministry of Coal. My role in this project of assembly of the embedded hardware and design the code sketch by which our project works. Also the ideation be done me and my friends. This project was part of our Design Engineering Project where we excelled and explored about Embedded Systems and IoT. The hardware used are ESP32 NodeMCU, HX711 Amplifier, Scale sensor. The softwares used Arduino IDE, Google Sheets.</p>

      <li>
        <strong>VLSI Physical Design</strong>
        <br>
        <p>In 2 weeks internship, I have explored a chain of software tools i.e.
          OpenROAD Flow Scripts which is based on linux. This software used to
          create RTL to GDSII with various steps in between this two stages of IC
          design.</p>
